    when are the other options are coming so there are no other options, there was
    a lot of that if you leave the room long before but now you are stuck in this
    room.\r\n\r\nThe only way to leave this room is to close the game and play again,
    which I know you are not gonna do because you love this room so much, so enjoy
    your stay.\n"
